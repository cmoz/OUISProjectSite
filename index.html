        <h2>About OUIS</h2>
        <p>Conductive fabric is fabric that conducts electricity. 
            Typically there are metal strands woven into the fabric, or the metal strands might be woven with other fabrics, such as polyester. 
            Making e-textiles, wearables, and soft circuits often use conductive fabrics for a variety of projects.

    <h3>What are we making?</h3>
    <p>In this project, we are creating an Open Universal Input Sleeve.
        This adds touch input capabilities quickly and stylishly to your projects!</p>
    <p>Why do you need the sleeve?
        Using this sleeve, in any configuration can provide inputs for your electronic projects.
        You can connect it to any circuit board and - use it for touch input (native on an ESP32 board, for example),
        adding touch capabilities to any project.
        If your microprocessor board doesn't have native touch capability,
        you can use a touch library (ADCTouch, I'll provide a code example at the end of this guide) to add this to an
        Arduino-based board.
        Once you've followed along to create a basic sleeve, you can modify this in infinite ways! Share your creation -
        what fabrics will you use?
        How many touch inputs? What shapes and styles will you add?</p>
